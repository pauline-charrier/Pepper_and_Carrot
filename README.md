# Pepper & Carrot scripts

This repository contains Python scripts allowing for automatic extraction and alignment of bilingual corpora from the website __Pepper&Carrot__.
More specifically, the scripts align Occitan texts (Lengadocian and Gascon varieties) with their translations in other languages.

[__Pepper&Carrot__](https://www.peppercarrot.com/fr/) is a free and open-source French webcomic created by David Revoy, where contributors are invited to provide translations for each episode.
The scripts directly rely on these translations to achieve the alignments.
